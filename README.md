### âœ… ToDoApp
- Builds a simple to-do list and note-taking app using object-oriented programming
- Defines and uses the following classes:
  - `Note` â€“ represents a note with title, content, subject, and date
  - `ToDoItem` â€“ extends `Note` to add completion status, due date, and priority
  - `NoteManager` â€“ manages a list of notes and to-do items; includes search, sort, and filter features
  - `TodoList` â€“ tracks a list of tasks and calculates overall progress
  - `MenuUI` â€“ placeholder for user interface logic (not yet implemented)
  - `Main` â€“ entry point that creates and displays a sample note
- Great practice for:
  - Building and organizing classes using OOP principles
  - Using inheritance and method overriding
  - Managing collections with `ArrayList`
  - Filtering and sorting objects
  - Working with dates using `LocalDateTime`
